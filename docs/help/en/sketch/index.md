# Sketch: an overview

A sketch is the flat drawing the geometry of a part stands on. You draw an outline, give it constraints and
dimensions, then turn it into a body: extrude, revolve, sweep. The sheet of a sketch is always flat: you move and
zoom it, but do not turn it in space.

## How to start and finish

**Sketch** (the pencil, key **K**), then a click on a plane, a datum plane or a face of the part. **Finish** in the
bar above leaves the sketch; a sketch you have just finished stays selected — the next part tool (**Extrude**,
**Revolve**) takes it at once.

## The main rule: a sketch must be defined

The properties of the sketch on the right show how many **degrees of freedom** are left: "N constraint(s)/
dimension(s) short — the yellow points can still move". While there are more than zero, the sketch "floats": it looks right, but may
move at the first edit. A defined sketch behaves predictably: change a dimension — exactly what it sets changes.

## What it is made of

- **Entities** — lines, circles, arcs, ellipses, splines, text.
- **Constraints** — rules between them: horizontal, vertical, coincident, parallel, perpendicular, equal, tangent,
  symmetric, point on a line, point on a circle.
- **Dimensions** — constraints with a number: a length, an angle, a radius, a diameter. The number can be a
  **formula**.

## How you draw

A tool is turned on with a button on the left or a key and stays in hand: you can draw several lines in a row. **Esc**
puts the tool down. **Text** puts itself down as soon as the label is placed. If an icon is unclear, rest the pointer on it — the hint names it and its key.

**Auto constraints** (the magic wand in the bar above) add the obvious by themselves: draw a nearly horizontal line —
get a horizontal. If one is wrong, delete it in the list of constraints on the right: hover a row — the constraint
lights up, **Del** deletes it.

## Construction geometry

Key **X** toggles construction mode: such lines are dashed, stay out of the body's profile and serve as supports —
centrelines, diagonals, circles for patterns.
