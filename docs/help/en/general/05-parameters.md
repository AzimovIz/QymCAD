# Parameters and formulas

Every numeric field in the program takes an **expression**, not just a number: `40/2`, `w*2`,
`len+5`, `sin(30)*10`, `pi*d`.

![Project parameters: `h` is computed from `w`, and `d` from `w` and `wall`. Change one number and all of them follow.](img/params.png)

## Global parameters

Press **ƒx Parameters** in the bar above — the window of the document's parameters opens: a name, an expression, a
value. **Add a parameter** makes a row; a name is letters, digits and "_", not starting with a digit. A parameter can
refer to another one: `d = w/2`.

That name then works in any field: in a sketch dimension, in an extrusion height, in a fillet radius, in an array
spacing, in a joint angle. A field offers to finish a name you are typing from a list — **Enter** takes it.

## What it is for

One number the whole part depends on must live **in one place**. Sheet thickness, fastener pitch,
shaft diameter — if they are retyped into twenty fields, one day you will fix nineteen of them.

A practical habit: create the parameters before drawing and type their names straight away. That is
cheaper than coming back and replacing numbers later.

## Named sketch dimensions

A sketch dimension can be **named** and then becomes available as a parameter. That is how a skeleton
is built: the main sketch sets the overall sizes, and the parts take their dimensions from its named
ones.

## If it did not work

- A formula does not count — its row has no value, and below the table it says what is wrong: an unknown name, an
  extra bracket. Circular references (`a = b + 1`, `b = a + 1`) do not count either, and the table says so.
- A name is not taken — it is already in use or cannot stand in a formula; the table says why.
- A parameter deleted with the bin button in its row while something used it — those operations turn red with the
  reason "unknown name: … — there is no such parameter", and the body stays as it was. **Ctrl+Z** brings the
  parameter back.
