# The build tree

The tree on the left is the document. Everything is in it: parts and subassemblies, sketches, datums, bodies and
**the timeline** — each operation on a row of its own, in the order it is carried out.

## What you can do in the tree

- **Select** — a click; the selection shows in the properties on the right.
- **Step into** a part or a subassembly — a double-click.
- **Open an operation for editing** — a double-click on its timeline row: the same tool opens with the same fields,
  **Enter** applies the edit, **Esc** leaves things as they were.
- **Hide** — the tick box of a row: the body or the sketch goes out without being deleted.
- **Right button** on an operation: **Rename**, **Edit**, **Up** / **Down**, **Suppress** (the operation is skipped,
  the timeline goes on from the body as it was before it), **Roll back to here**, **Delete**. On a sketch also
  **Move** it to another plane, **Copy**, **Cut** and export to SVG or DXF.
- **Copy an operation**: select its row, **Ctrl+C**, then **Ctrl+V** — its tool opens with the same values, a click
  places the copy, **Enter** applies it.

## The bodies of a part

Inside a part, above the **Construction** timeline, stands the list **Bodies (N)** — a row for every body the part
shows. Usually there is one; the pieces of [Split body](part/13-split-body) and of a cut that goes right through the
part are rows of their own. A click on a row picks the body and lights it on the canvas, the tick hides it, the right
button offers **Rename** and **Make a part**: a name is asked beside the cursor, **Enter** moves the body into a part
of its own.

## Deleting

**Del** or **Delete** in the menu. The program asks and says how much is built on what you delete. By default only
the row itself goes: whatever stood on it stays in the timeline in red with the reason — to be repaired or deleted.
The tick box **Delete what is built on it too** removes it all at once. A mistake — **Ctrl+Z**.

## Search

The **Search the tree** field above the tree keeps the rows whose names contain what you typed. On a part of fifty
operations this is faster than looking.

## Order is not decoration

The order of the timeline rows is the order of building: a fillet before a cut and the same fillet after it are
different shapes. **Up** and **Down** move a row; if the move would tear an operation off what it stands on, the
button is grey.

The orange **rollback line** at the bottom of the timeline shows how far the timeline is built. Drag it up — the model
becomes what it was at that step; new operations go in at the line. **Clear the rollback** takes the line back down.

## If it did not work

- A row is red — the operation has an error; the reason shows on hovering and in the properties. Open it with a
  double-click and fix the values or what it stands on.
- **Up** / **Down** are grey — the move would break a dependency. Move what the operation stands on first.
