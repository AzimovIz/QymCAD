# Datum planes, axes and points

Datum geometry is what you build from when there is no face or edge of your own: a plane for a sketch, an axis for a
revolve or a pattern, a point for an axis or a dimension.

## Datum plane — key D

Press **Datum plane**, click a base plane (XY, XZ, YZ), another datum plane or a face of the part, type the **Offset**
into the field at the geometry and press **Enter**. The offset may be negative and takes a formula.

## Datum axis

Press **Datum axis** and choose how to set it in the bar above:

- click a **straight edge** — the axis runs along it;
- click a **cylindrical face** — the axis runs along the axis of the cylinder;
- **2 points** — click two vertices, the axis passes through them;
- **By hand** — type the origin (O.x, O.y, O.z) and the direction (Dir.x, Dir.y, Dir.z).

**Enter** makes the axis.

## Datum point

Press **Datum point**: in the **Coordinates** mode type X, Y, Z, in the **To a vertex** mode click a vertex of the part.
**Enter** makes the point.

## A datum follows the geometry

A plane taken from a face, an axis along an edge or a cylinder, a point on a vertex remember what they were taken
from: the part changes — the datum rebuilds, and everything standing on it with it. A plane taken from a base plane
and an axis or a point given in numbers do not depend on the part — you start from them when there is nothing yet to
build on.

## If it did not work

- The datum is red — what it was taken from is gone: a fillet ate the face, an edge went away after an edit. Open the
  datum with a double-click and pick it again.
- An axis by two points is not made — the vertices coincide. An axis "By hand" with a zero direction is not made
  either.
