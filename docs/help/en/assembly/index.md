# Assembly: an overview

An assembly places parts against each other. A part stays itself: it keeps its own history, its own
sketches and its own single body — the assembly only says where it stands and how it moves.

## Components

The assembly tree is made of components: parts and sub-assemblies. A double click **goes inside** a
component, and from there you work with it like an ordinary part; the path on top shows where you are.

## Joints

Position is set by **joints**, rules between parts, rather than by coordinates:

- **Rigid** — the parts are tied solid, zero degrees of freedom.
- **Revolute** — one axis of rotation: a hinge, a pulley.
- **Slider** — one translation along an axis.
- **Cylindrical** — rotation and translation along the same axis: a shaft in a plain bearing.
- **Planar** — two translations in a plane and a rotation in it: a part lying on a table.
- **Ball** — three rotations about a point.
- **Pin-slot** — rotation about one axis and translation along another.
- **Parallel** — holds the direction only; where the part sits is its own business.

A joint's anchor is **inferred under the cursor**: the middle of a face gives its centre, an edge its
midpoint, a circular rim the hole centre, an edge end a vertex. You do not declare in advance what
you are about to pick.

The parts are placed so that all joints hold at once. The properties of a joint show how many degrees of freedom the
driven part has left, and if the joints ask something incompatible, the program says that they conflict.

## Patterns, mirrors and clones

A row of bolts is placed by a [component pattern](assembly/04-arrays) — one row of the assembly timeline. The left
bracket from the right one is a **Mirrored copy** of the part. **Make a clone** (the right button on the part in the
tree) places the same part once more: editing the original changes the clone too, while it stands and mates on its
own.

## Interference check

A separate check shows where parts **run into each other**. On an assembly built from joints this is
the first thing worth looking at before release.

## Top-down design

One part's sketch can stand on another part's face — then an explicit **external reference** appears
between them. That is how a bracket's dimensions come from the housing instead of being retyped into
it. The reference shows in the properties of the part and can be broken — [more](assembly/06-external-refs).
