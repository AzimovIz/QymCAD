//! STEP AND IGES READ AT ONCE, from threads side by side, give what they give one after the other - and the process
//! lives.
//!
//! Measured on the check that reopens a STEP and an IGES assembly side by side: 1 run of 25 died with SIGSEGV, and once
//! in a whole run it grew to 24 GB and took the machine into swap; one after the other it passed 25 of 25. Both crashes
//! stood in the same place: the first IGES reader made (`IGESControl_Controller::Init`, dying in `MoniTool_TypedValue`)
//! while another thread made the first STEP one (`STEPControl_Controller::Init`). Each kind sets OCCT's data exchange up
//! the first time it is made, in process-wide state, and each was held by a lock of its own. An import runs on a worker
//! thread, so a document holding both can bring them together.
