//! A FACE THAT DID NOT TESSELLATE LEAVES A HOLE IN THE BODY.
//!
//! Reported with a screenshot: a gap in an imported part where the shell should be - you look through the
//! surface into the inside. Measured on the reporter's document: 399 bodies out of 1296 have an unclosed
//! shell, with open edges up to 102 mm long. That length rules out a seam that failed to weld: a whole face
//! is missing.
//!
//! WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE, measured here: in that place the model itself has no face. Every one of the
//! solid`s 339 faces tessellates, the accuracy changes nothing, the triangles are wound outwards (asked by a
//! ray from each face), and the gap is bounded by two circles of 368 and 353 mm - the two ends of a missing
//! band of a cylinder. The kernel calls the solid unsound, and neither its own repair nor sewing with a
//! tolerance of up to half a millimetre closes it. Healing a model that arrives with a face missing is a piece
//! of work of its own, and this measurement is what it would start from.
//!
//! The fixture is one solid of the reporter's file, saved aside: `target/look/body-490.brep`, 365 KB against
//! the 287 MB the document weighs.
