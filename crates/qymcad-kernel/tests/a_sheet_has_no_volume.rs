//! A SHEET HOLDS NO VOLUME: a surface stitched from faces that do not close is a surface, and its volume is zero.

//! Reported behaviour: two faces copied off a block and stitched along their shared edge weighed 2000 mm^3 - the volume
//! of an open shell was taken as if it were closed, and the part with the block counted 14000 instead of 12000.
