//! A HEAVY MESH IS OFFERED ITS SIMPLIFICATION when it is picked for recognition: the field "Simplify, mm" gets a
//! ten-thousandth of the mesh's size, and a light mesh keeps zero. Reported behaviour: a body made from a
//! 178 000-triangle mesh as it is rebuilt for minutes after every operation, and nothing said so beforehand.
