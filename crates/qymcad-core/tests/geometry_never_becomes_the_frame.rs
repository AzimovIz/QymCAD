//! GEOMETRY DRAWN AT ZERO MUST STAY THE PERSON'S GEOMETRY, and not become the origin itself.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: "I cannot move a circle away from the origin with the move tool". The centre of a
//! circle drawn at (0,0) was the origin point: `merge_close_points` glues whatever lands at zero INTO the
//! origin and keeps the origin's id, and `immovable_points` holds the system points - so the drawing was
//! nailed down by the frame of reference it merely touched.
//!
//! The repair that used to cover this, `detach_geometry_from_origin`, only fires once the origin has
//! already wandered off zero; `pin_frame` now keeps it at zero, so it never fires.
