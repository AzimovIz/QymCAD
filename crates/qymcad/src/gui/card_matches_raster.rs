//! THE CARD AND THE SOFTWARE RASTER MUST DRAW THE SAME BODY.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: extruded text lost its walls on screen - "the faces fell apart" - while the software
//! raster drew the same document correctly. Everything that happens below the vertices is invisible to a check
//! that reads numbers: the culling, the shading, the look table, the indices. None of it crashes when wrong;
//! it draws the body wrong.
//!
//! So both renderers draw the same scene and the pictures are compared by SILHOUETTE - which pixels the body
//! covers. The colours differ by design (the raster shades per vertex, the card per fragment), the coverage
//! must not.
