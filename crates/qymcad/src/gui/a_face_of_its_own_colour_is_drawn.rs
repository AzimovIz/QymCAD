//! A FACE OF A COLOUR OF ITS OWN IS DRAWN IN IT, by both painters: the software raster and the scene handed to the
//! graphics device.
//!
//! The reference is the kernel's `tests/data/assembly.step`: two red plates, the top face of the plate green - a colour
//! the file gives that face alone - and a blue pin. Green is on the picture only where that face is.
