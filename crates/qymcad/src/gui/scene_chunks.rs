//! A SCENE TOO BIG FOR ONE BUFFER IS DRAWN IN PIECES.
//!
//! Reported behaviour, on the heaviest reference file (a V8 engine in STEP): the program died on opening it
//! with `Buffer size 739358112 is greater than the maximum buffer size (268435456)`. Every vertex of the
//! scene went into ONE vertex buffer, and a graphics device has a limit on how big one buffer may be - 256 MB
//! is the ordinary one. The engine holds 23 million vertices at 32 bytes each.
//!
//! The cure is not a bigger buffer (the limit belongs to the device) but several of them, drawn one after
//! another. The arithmetic of "where to cut" lives here, apart from the graphics, so it can be measured
//! without a GPU.
//!
//! THE UNIT OF CUTTING IS A BLOCK, not a vertex. While the scene was drawn unindexed, a body could be
//! written across the seam of two buffers in two goes; an indexed draw reads its vertices from ONE buffer, so
//! a body has to lie inside one piece entire.

/// HOW MANY VERTICES AND INDICES ONE PIECE MAY HOLD, by the device's own limit on a single buffer.
///
/// Two numbers, not one: a closed mesh has about twice as many triangles as vertices, that is six indices per
/// vertex at 4 bytes each - 24 bytes of indices against 20 bytes of vertex. The index buffer reaches the
/// limit FIRST, and a piece cut by vertices alone would overflow it.
