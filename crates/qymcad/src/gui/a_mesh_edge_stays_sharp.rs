//! A MESH'S SHARP EDGE STAYS SHARP ON BOTH PAINTERS. A mesh from a file shares its vertices across its edges, and
//! light smoothed over every shared vertex made a cube bulge like a cushion: a gradient over every face on the
//! software picture, eight vertices lit along the diagonals in the device's scene.
//!
//! Reported behaviour, measured: the owner's print head from PLY showed streaks along the edges and fillets of the
//! housing, 0.79 % of the picture apart from the head from STEP, where the same triangles with vertices of their own
//! came 0.03 % apart.
