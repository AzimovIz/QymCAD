//! A BODY DOES NOT FALL APART IN PERSPECTIVE. Written from two reported screenshots.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: changing the perspective angle breaks the bodies — holes appear in them, thin
//! faces fall apart, gaps show through — and a ring in the screenshot broke into separate ribbons.
//! Both on the CPU and on the GPU.
//!
//! The two paths had one thing in common: back-face culling was computed ORTHOGONALLY,
//! `dot(n, fwd) >= 0`, under a perspective projection. In an orthographic view the ray of sight is one
//! for the whole frame, and `fwd` is that ray. In perspective the ray is different at every point, and
//! near the edges of the frame it diverges from `fwd` the more, the wider the field of view. The error
//! went BOTH ways: visible faces were culled (gaps in the body) and invisible ones were kept (the ring
//! in ribbons).
//!
//! The defect had been there before — perspective has been in the program for a long time. It is just
//! that with a hard-coded angle of 35.5 degrees the divergence was small, and it only became visible
//! once the angle became a setting.
//!
//! SINCE THEN THE NORMAL LEFT THE VERTEX, and the two paths answer the question differently. The raster still
//! asks it of the world normal and the ray from the eye; the card asks `front_facing` - the winding of the
//! triangle as it came out on screen - which is the same question answered per triangle and per point, and so
//! exact in perspective by construction.
//!
//! THIS FILE ONCE PROVED THE WRONG THING. It read the shader as text and was satisfied by a line that
//! discarded exactly the faces it should have kept: `cross(dpdx, dpdy)` is built from the screen basis and
//! points along the line of sight for EVERY triangle, so testing it against that same line of sight is a test
//! of nothing. Extruded text lost its walls on screen while every check stayed green. What can only be seen in
//! a picture is now checked in a picture - `gui/card_matches_raster.rs` draws the same scene both ways and
//! compares them - and what is left here is the rule on the raster's side plus the fact that the card culls at
//! all.
