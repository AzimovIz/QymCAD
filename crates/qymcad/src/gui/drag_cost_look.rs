//! WHAT A FRAME COSTS WHILE SOMETHING IS BEING DRAGGED - and what it does NOT do.
//!
//! A coarser draft accuracy during a drag pays only if meshing takes a noticeable share of a step - a fifth or
//! more; below that there is nothing to gain from it.
//!
//! THE ANSWER, measured here: a drag builds no geometry at all. A corner of a sketch under the hand solves
//! the sketch and redraws; the body is rebuilt when the hand lets go. The arrow of a feature's size writes a
//! number and draws an outline; the body is built on Enter. Twenty steps of each, and the geometry changed on
//! none of them.
//!
//! So the two checks below guard that finding rather than measuring a share: the day a drag starts rebuilding
//! the document, meshing appears under the hand and a draft accuracy becomes worth having - and that day this
//! goes red.
