//! A SELECTED BODY OF A NEIGHBOURING PART: what the two flags of the shading actually decide.
//!
//! `shade_tri` takes `hot` (the body is selected) and `ghost` (the body belongs to a neighbouring context),
//! and it is tempting to read them as one word of three, the way the shell's `outward` + `center` turned out
//! to be. They are not: `hot` decides the COLOUR and, with it, the opacity, while `ghost` decides WHICH PASS
//! the triangle is drawn in - the blended one, without a z-write.
//!
//! Measured here rather than argued, because the first reading of the same code was wrong: the `al` computed
//! beside the call looks like the ghost's transparency, but it only picks the bucket, and the alpha that
//! actually reaches the screen is the one `shade_tri` returned.
