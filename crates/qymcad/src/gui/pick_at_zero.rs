//! WHAT A CLICK HANDS BACK AT ZERO IS THE PERSON'S GEOMETRY, and never the frame of reference.
//!
//! Four points stand at or beside the origin of every sketch a person has touched: the origin itself, the
//! anchor of the frame at the same (0,0), and the two axis guides one millimetre away at (1,0) and (0,1). At
//! the ordinary zoom of 6 px per mm a guide is 6 px from zero while the pick radius of a point is 10 - so a
//! click at zero has four candidates, three of which belong to the frame and not to the drawing.
//!
//! `sketch_hit`, which serves selection, knows this: it skips the anchor and the guides and lets ordinary
//! geometry win over the origin. `nearest_sketch_point`, which serves dimensions, references and the corner
//! tools, did not - and it is a different door to the same sketch.
