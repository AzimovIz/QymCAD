//! A KEY OF THE CATALOGUE ON THE SCREEN INSTEAD OF A WORD, recognised by its shape in every frame the window of the
//! checks draws.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: here and there the names of labels are seen rather than their translations. A check that
//! looks only for keys the catalogue holds misses the worst case - a key the catalogue lacks is drawn as it is, and it
//! is no key of the catalogue. So a word is taken for a key by its shape: its part before the first dash is the part a
//! key of the catalogue begins with (`f-`, `feat-name-`, `sk-`), and no translation in any language holds such a word
//! (the catalogue itself writes words like `point-on-line`, and those are words).
