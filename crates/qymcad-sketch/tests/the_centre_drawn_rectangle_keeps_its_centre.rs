//! A RECTANGLE DRAWN FROM ITS CENTRE KEEPS THE CENTRE WHILE THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT ARE TYPED.
//!
//! Reported behaviour: a "centre + corner" rectangle is drawn by a click in the centre and a click in
//! the corner, the little width-by-height window opens, "25" is typed as the width - and the centre
//! binding is gone, the point has travelled away.
//!
//! WHERE IT WENT WRONG. The width-by-height popup remembered two CORNERS: the mirrored opposite corner
//! and the corner clicked. Typing a new width rebuilt the rectangle FROM THE MIRRORED CORNER, so the
//! centre - the very point the rectangle was drawn from - travelled with every keystroke. The first
//! click (the centre) was never stored anywhere: the popup had nothing to hold on to.
//!
//! THE COMPANION. A rectangle drawn from two corners must keep behaving as before: the first corner
//! stays, the corner under the pointer follows the numbers. Without this the fix could be "always grow
//! about the centre", which would move corner-drawn rectangles people have already placed.
