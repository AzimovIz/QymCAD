//! THE VIEW AND THE MOUSE: turning, moving and scaling the view under every mouse layout the settings offer, the
//! wheel scaling from the cursor or from the middle, the cube, fitting the view, the flat sheet and the space, and
//! the perspective.
//!
//! What the eye reads off the screen is where the corners of the block are seen - the three corners of one corner
//! of it. Moving the view moves all three the same way, scaling pulls them apart from one place, turning changes
//! the shape they make, and nothing of it touches the document.
