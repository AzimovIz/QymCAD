//! WHAT A SKETCH BECOMES, ACROSS PROFILES, OPERATIONS AND VALUES: an extrusion to a length, symmetric, to two sides,
//! flipped, through all; added, cut, intersected; of a rectangle, a circle, a rectangle round a circle, two squares
//! apart, a square on the block and a circle over its edge; a revolution about either axis, whole and in part, of a
//! rectangle and of a circle off the axis or across it. Values ordinary, small, large, zero and below. What each case
//! must come to is worked out from the geometry.
