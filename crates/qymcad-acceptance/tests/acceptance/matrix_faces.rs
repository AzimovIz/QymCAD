//! THE TOOLS THAT WORK ON FACES ACROSS BODIES, PICKS AND VALUES: a shell, a hole, a face pushed, a face thickened,
//! faces split, faces removed, a face tilted by a draft - on a block, a cylinder, a block with a hole, a chamfer, a
//! rounding, a notch or a boss; values ordinary, small, near the limit the geometry sets and past it, zero and below.
//! What each case must come to is worked out from the geometry.
//!
//! The level before a release adds undo and redo, save and open, and rebuilding everything to every body built.
