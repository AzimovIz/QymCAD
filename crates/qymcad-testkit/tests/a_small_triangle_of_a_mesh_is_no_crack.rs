//! A SMALL TRIANGLE OF A MESH IS NO CRACK. The common funnel of every operation takes out cracks - faces narrower than
//! the precision a limiting rounding leaves - and it knew them by their area alone. A body made of a mesh has thousands
//! of faces under that area that are not narrow at all, and each operation on such a body copied it whole and ran the
//! repair of small faces over it for nothing: measured on a 178 032-triangle mesh, 50 s of every operation, with not one
//! face taken out.
