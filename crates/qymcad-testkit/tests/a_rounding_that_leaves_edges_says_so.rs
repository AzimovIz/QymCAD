//! A ROUNDING THAT LEAVES EDGES OUT SAYS SO, and builds the rest: a block of 40 x 30 x 10 rounded 11 on an upright edge
//! and a top edge - the upright takes 11 between faces of 30 and 40, the top one cannot, its side being 10 high - and
//! the node carries a warning in words rather than standing green or going red with everything after it.
