//! SPLITTING A PREPARED MESH INTO REGIONS, each lying on one surface: a plane, a cylinder, a cone, a sphere or a
//! torus.
//!
//! By the angle between triangles alone it cannot be done. Measured on a bar with every edge rounded (26 faces),
//! the angle across the border of two faces was 0.12 - 6.5 deg while the angle inside a rounding reached 14.3 deg:
//! the faces meet tangent, and any threshold that keeps a rounding whole glues the whole bar into one region. So a
//! region is grown together with its surface. A seed is given a plane, cylinders, cones and spheres in turn; each
//! grows over the neighbours whose corners lie on it; the one that covers the most area is kept. A rounding's first
//! strip lies 0.017 mm off the plane it leaves, far outside the tolerance. Then neighbours whose union lies on one
//! surface are joined - that is how a torus comes together from its bands - and what is left lying on a larger
//! neighbour's surface joins it.
