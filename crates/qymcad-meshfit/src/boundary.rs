//! WHERE REGIONS MEET: the corners and the edges of the faces a mesh was split into, before any curve is fitted to
//! them.
//!
//! A side of a triangle whose neighbour lies in another region - or that has no neighbour - is a side of a border, and
//! the region on its left walks it along the triangle's winding. A region's border sides link into loops by turning
//! about the corner each ends in, through the region's own triangles. Where the region across changes along a loop,
//! the loop passes a corner of the solid; a loop along which it never changes is one closed edge, a washer's round
//! edge. Every corner of a border side is a corner of triangles of both regions, so it lies on both surfaces within the
//! tolerance: a false corner can stand no farther from a true one than two tangent surfaces stay within the tolerance
//! of each other, about sqrt(2 x tolerance x radius) - 0.09 mm on a bar rounded by 2 mm.
