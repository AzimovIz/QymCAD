//! Turning a triangle mesh into exact surfaces. The chain: prepare the mesh (weld, adjacency, holes,
//! orientation), split it into regions of smoothly joined triangles, fit a primitive to each region, then build
//! faces on the fitted surfaces; the kernel builds the body out of them (`qymcad_kernel::recognise`).
//!
//! No interface lives here: the recognition tool calls into this crate and shows what it found.
